# <h1 align="center">Ponzio The Cat Token</h1>

Welcome to the Ponzio The Cat token project! This token is a unique creation on the Ethereum blockchain, designed by a team of individuals with IQs that soar beyond comprehension. The Ponzio token is not just a cryptocurrency; it's a testament to unparalleled intellect and audacity in the world of decentralized finance.

## Features

The Ponzio token operates on a set of groundbreaking principles that defy conventional wisdom in the cryptocurrency space. Here's a brief overview of its features:

- **Supply Reduction:** The total supply of Ponzio tokens is halved every 4 days, ensuring scarcity and driving up the price over time.
- **Continuous Debase:** Every 34 minutes, a small debase occurs, further enhancing the token's upward price trajectory.
- **Liquidity Pool Incentives:** By providing liquidity to the Ponzio token's liquidity pool (LP) and staking LP tokens, users receive an additional 13.37% of debased tokens as a reward.
- **Price Trajectory:** With a combination of supply reduction, continuous debase, and liquidity incentives, the Ponzio token is engineered to reach astronomical prices, making it an irresistible investment opportunity.
